//! The live half of AllMyStuff: what the static [`allmystuff_graph`] model
//! becomes once peers are actually connected. It tracks **who's here**
//! (presence) and **what's running** (the route handshake), as a pure,
//! deterministic state machine — no sockets, no audio devices — so the
//! whole connection lifecycle is unit-tested here and the Tauri backend
//! just feeds it messages and carries out the [`Effect`]s it returns.
//!
//! Lifecycle of a route:
//!
//! ```text
