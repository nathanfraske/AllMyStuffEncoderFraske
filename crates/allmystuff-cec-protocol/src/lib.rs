//! # allmystuff-cec-protocol
//!
//! The wire contract and shared constants for **CEC Support** — Critical
//! Error Computing's one-tap remote help desk. It lives in the AllMyStuff
//! workspace because both sides speak it: the technician side (an AllMyStuff
//! install joined to a customer's support mesh) and the standalone CEC Support
//! client app, which reuses this crate through the shared node engine.
//!
//! CEC Support rides on the [MyOwnMesh](https://github.com/mrjeeves/MyOwnMesh)
//! peer-to-peer substrate, but with two deliberate twists that make it behave
//! like AnyDesk rather than an ordinary always-on mesh:
//!
//! 1. **One shared support area, hub-shaped.** Every CEC node — the customer
//!    running the CEC Support app, and every technician's AllMyStuff install —
//!    lives on the one well-known mesh, [`HELP_NETWORK_ID`]
//!    (`cecsupport-clients`). Under its hub topology (`CEC_HELP_HUBS`),
//!    customers hold connections only to CEC-operated infra hubs — never to
//!    each other — and see nobody. Raising a hand is a
//!    [`SupportPresence`] beacon on the area; the customer's short
//!    [`SupportId`](ids::SupportId) number is a display/verification label
//!    derived from the device key (readable over the phone as the fallback
//!    when the queue is crowded), never a room name. A mesh is just a
//!    signaling namespace — one area carries discovery, hand-raising, and
//!    the session itself.
//! 2. **Deliberate dial, then approve.** The technician answers a raised
//!    hand (or resolves a phoned-in number to its device) and *explicitly*
//!    dials that device on the area. The customer then approves with one of
//!    three choices — [`ApprovalScope`] `Once` / `ThreeHours` / `Forever` —
//!    and can revoke at any time. Approval state lives in
//!    `allmystuff-cec-consent`; this crate defines only the *messages* and
//!    the *scope*.
//!
//! ## Isolation from other MyOwnMesh ecosystems
//!
//! CEC Support forks MyOwnMesh's signing tags and home dir so its signatures
//! never cross-verify against an AllMyStuff / MyOwnMesh / MyOwnLLM mesh and its
//! identity + state never collide with an existing install. It deliberately does
//! *not* fork the signaling app-id: the support area's well-known `network_id`
//! seeds a distinct room handle, so technician and customer meet on the
//! default app-id with no env override.
//!
//! - [`CEC_SIGN_DOMAIN_TAG`] / [`CEC_SIGN_DOMAIN_TAG_STATE`] — domain-separated
//!   signing tags.
//! - [`CEC_HOME_ENV`] — a CEC-specific home dir (`MYOWNMESH_HOME` override) so
//!   identity + state never collide with an existing AllMyStuff install.
