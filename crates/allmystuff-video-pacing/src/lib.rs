//! Bounded frame-completion pacing. Pure monotonic accounting, no IO.
//!
//! These are the existing AllMyStuff application policies, including their
//! floors, recovery headroom, LAN ceiling and diagnostic overrides. Callers
//! provide local timestamps, retain bucket state and perform the returned wait.
//! This crate does not provide transport, congestion control or admission.
//!
//! Arithmetic domains are unchanged: an override above `u64::MAX / 1_000_000`
//! can overflow its multiplication (panic with overflow checks, wrap without
//! them), and an unrepresentable future `Instant` can panic during reservation.
//! Keep overrides and reservation schedules within those domains. This move
//! adds no validation or new policy for extreme inputs.
