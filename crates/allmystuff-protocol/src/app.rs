//! AllMyStuff's own peer-to-peer protocol — the messages nodes exchange
//! *over* the mesh (inside the daemon's typed-channel frames) once they're
//! connected. Two channels:
//!
//!  * **presence** — each node broadcasts a [`NodeProfile`]: who it is, a
//!    thumbnail of its hardware, and the capabilities it's willing to wire
//!    up. This is what populates the other side's graph.
//!  * **control** — point-to-point [`ControlMessage`]s that set up and
//!    tear down routes and negotiate shares.
//!
//! Authorization is *not* on the wire: a node only ever advertises or
//! accepts what the local [`allmystuff_graph::Catalog`] already permits.
//! The wire carries intent; the catalog is the gate.
