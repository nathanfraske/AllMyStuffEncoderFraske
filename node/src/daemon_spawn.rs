//! Daemon lifecycle. AllMyStuff drives a `myownmesh serve` daemon as its
//! mesh sidecar; if one isn't already listening, we spawn it and hold the
//! handle for the app's lifetime (killing the GUI kills the child via
//! `Drop`). This mirrors the MyOwnMesh GUI's daemon spawner, minus the
//! source-checkout dev path — AllMyStuff ships against an installed
//! `myownmesh` (pinned in `.myownmesh-rev`), found on `$PATH` or via the
//! `MYOWNMESH_BIN` override. A binary that's fallen behind the pin is
//! asked to update itself (`myownmesh update`, the same thing the
//! installer invokes) before we start it, so the mesh comes up with the
//! features this app was built against.
