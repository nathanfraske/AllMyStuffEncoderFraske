//! OS-level reboot of *this* machine — the action behind the gear menu's
//! "Restart this device" and the [`AppControl::RestartDevice`] command a
//! fleet peer sends. One step heavier than relaunching the app: for the
//! wedge an app restart can't clear (a hung compositor, a stuck driver, a
//! box that needs its pending OS updates applied).
//!
//! The reboot is *asked of the OS*, never forced from here: each platform's
//! ordinary reboot mechanism runs with this process's privileges, so the
//! OS's own rules stay in charge (an unprivileged Linux session goes
//! through logind/polkit, macOS through System Events, Windows through
//! `shutdown.exe`'s SeShutdownPrivilege). Attempts run in order and the
//! first success wins; if they all refuse, the caller gets every reason —
//! a refusal must be visible, not a silent nothing-happened.
//!
//! [`AppControl::RestartDevice`]: allmystuff_protocol::AppControl::RestartDevice
