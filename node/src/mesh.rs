//! The live mesh: wires the daemon's typed channels to the
//! [`allmystuff_session::Session`] state machine and the [`AudioBridge`].
//!
//! On start it subscribes to the AllMyStuff presence / control / media
//! channels on every joined network, broadcasts this node's
//! [`NodeProfile`], and pumps inbound frames:
//!
//!  * **presence** → updates the peer set (the graph fills with real peers).
//!  * **control** → drives the route handshake; the [`Effect`]s it returns
//!    send replies and start/stop audio.

//!
//! Everything the front-end sees comes through `allmystuff://session`
