//! The video media plane: capture of this machine's screens **and
//! cameras**, so an active display or camera route actually streams
//! pixels — H.264 on the mesh's track lane, MJPEG as the compatibility
//! floor (the piKVM transport: every frame a standalone JPEG, no codec
//! state to desync).
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::audio::AudioBridge`]'s shape: each sourcing route runs
//! a dedicated thread that captures **what its source capability names**
//! (the synthetic `screen` is the primary monitor, `screen:<id>` one of
//! the others, a camera capability the OS camera it scanned — see
//! [`VideoSource`]), fits it to the transport's ceiling, encodes, and
//! hands the packet to a callback the mesh forwards. Everything from the
//! encoder down — transports, tuning, refresh asks, stats, the status
//! reports — is one pipeline; only the frame *source* differs, and camera
//! frames enter through the same pump the persistent screen sessions use
//! ([`crate::camera_capture`]).
//!
//! Capture prefers a **persistent session**: our own DXGI Output
//! Duplication on Windows (see [`crate::win_capture`] for why xcap's
//! recorder can't carry it), `xcap`'s `VideoRecorder` elsewhere (PipeWire
//! ScreenCast on Wayland, AVFoundation on macOS). The OS negotiates the
//! stream once per route and pushes frames, often only on damage. The
//! alternative — one `capture_image()` screenshot per tick — pays the
//! platform's full one-shot cost every frame (the Wayland portal literally
//! has the compositor write a PNG to disk per call), which is what made
//! v1's framerate so dire. The paced one-shot loop remains as the X11 path
//! (xcap's X11 "recorder" is that same screenshot in an unpaced hot loop)
//! and as the fallback wherever a session can't start (denied portal,
//! headless session, an output another session holds) — so the stream
//! degrades to v1 behaviour, never to nothing.
//!
//! The H.264 encoder budgets its bitrate from the monitor's true pixel
//! count and runs native resolution up to 4K by default; the edge, rate,
//! and bitrate are env-dialable for dial-in sessions (see the knobs by
//! [`target_fps`]).
//!
//! Two costs are skipped outright when they buy nothing: a frame whose
//! pixels match the previous one isn't re-encoded or re-sent (an idle
//! desktop costs one buffer compare per tick, with a periodic refresh so
//! late joiners aren't stranded), and when the link can't keep up the
//! bounded forwarder drops captures rather than queueing stale ones.
//!
//! Three failure modes the capture used to suffer silently are handled
//! here as part of the stream:
//!
//!  * **A sleeping display.** Hosting a route holds a keep-awake guard
//!    and nudges an already-asleep display at start (see [`crate::wake`])
//!    — damage-driven backends produce nothing from a dark screen, and a
//!    deep-sleeping DisplayPort monitor detaches from the desktop
//!    entirely (which is why a failed monitor lookup gets one retry
//!    after the nudge has had a beat to re-attach things).
//!  * **Wayland consent.** Route starts ride a portal session with a
//!    **restore token** ([`crate::wayland_capture`]): the compositor's
//!    share-picker is a once-per-machine event, and every start after it
//!    is silent — which is what an unattended host needs.
//!  * **Silence with no explanation.** Capture state changes travel to
//!    the viewer in-band (`vstat` media frames, [`StatusReporter`]):
//!    "waiting for consent", "display asleep", "no monitor", "grabs
//!    failing" — so the far end reads the real condition, never a
//!    wordless black stage.
