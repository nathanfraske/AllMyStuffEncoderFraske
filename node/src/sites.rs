//! The sites plane — AllMyStuff's reverse proxy.
//!
//! A *site* is a TCP service a machine is listening on (a local web app, a
//! database) that its owner chose to expose. This plane carries it across
//! the mesh so another of your machines can reach it through a locally-mapped
//! port — direct (the same number) when free, else remapped.
//!
//! Like [`crate::files::FilesPlane`], this struct is **state only**; the
//! [`crate::mesh::Mesh`] owns the async tasks (it captures the `Arc<Mesh>`
//! they need to send mesh frames). Two halves:
//!
//!  * **Host** (the machine the service runs on): on a [`SiteEvent::Open`]
//!    it connects to `127.0.0.1:<port>` — but only after re-checking the
//!    port is one it *currently advertises* ([`SitesProxy::is_port_exposed`]),
//!    the load-bearing control, so a peer can't pivot to an unexposed local
//!    service — and pumps bytes both ways.
//!  * **Client** (the machine reaching it): a local `TcpListener` accepts
//!    connections on the mapped port; each becomes one tunneled `conn`.
//!
//! One mesh route per (host, site) multiplexes every connection by `conn`
//! id. The byte transport is the JSON media channel (base64 like the files
//! plane), so this is for light/occasional access, not bulk throughput.
//!
//! It's a **transparent layer-4 tunnel** — raw bytes, no HTTP parsing, no
//! idle timeout, and each connection's read and write directions run as
//! independent tasks (full duplex). So it isn't limited to request/response
//! HTTP: a connection that the client upgrades to a **WebSocket** (or that
//! speaks Server-Sent Events, HTTP keep-alive, gRPC, SSH, a database wire
//! protocol…) keeps flowing both ways for its whole life, exactly as it
//! would direct. The proxy never interprets the stream; it just carries it.
