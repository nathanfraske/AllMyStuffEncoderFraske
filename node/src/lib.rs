//! AllMyStuff's headless mesh **node engine**.
//!
//! This crate is the machinery that used to live inside the desktop GUI's
//! Tauri backend (`gui/src-tauri/src`). It is a *client* of a `myownmesh
//! serve` daemon over the control socket and, on top of that link, runs:
//!
//!  * **presence** — broadcasts this machine's [`NodeProfile`] and tracks
//!    peers (the graph fills with real devices);
//!  * **the route handshake** — the [`allmystuff_session::Session`] state
//!    machine, auto-accepting authorized offers (owner/fleet gated);
//!  * **every media plane** — screen + camera ([`video`], the capture
//!    sessions in [`win_capture`] / [`wayland_capture`] / [`camera_capture`]),
//!    audio ([`audio`]), input injection ([`input_inject`]), the mesh-native
//!    terminal ([`terminal`]) and file manager ([`files`]), clipboard
//!    ([`clipboard`]), and exposed-service tunnels ([`sites`]);
//!  * **ownership + the owned fleet** ([`ownership`]).
//!
//! The one thing it does *not* own is where node events surface. That seam is
//! the [`UiSink`] trait: [`mesh::Mesh::new`] takes one and the engine emits
//! through it, knowing nothing about who (if anyone) listens.
//!
//! There is **one node per machine**, and it runs in the `allmystuff-serve`
//! binary. That binary wires in a [`node_control::SocketSink`], which logs each
//! event *and* fans it out to every client connected to the node's own control
//! socket ([`node_control`]). The desktop GUI is a thin client of that socket
//! ([`node_control::NodeClient`]): it drives the node with one request per
//! command and re-emits the streamed events onto Tauri's bus, rather than
//! linking the engine and running a second `Mesh` itself. (It used to do the
//! latter, with a Tauri-backed sink — but that put two nodes under one identity
//! on an Always-On machine, and then nothing could connect.)

// The capture/inject planes live behind the default-on `host` feature: real
// on every desktop/server build, swapped for same-API no-op stubs (see
// `stubs/`) on a capture-less build — iOS, whose sandbox has no PTY, screen
// grab, input injection, or OS clipboard to offer. The stub keeps the
// module's exact public surface so `mesh.rs` (and everything else) compiles
// identically either way; only what a route *does* changes (capture routes
// report failure, inject/clipboard writes drop). Viewer planes —
// `video_decode`, the terminal output queues, opus decode — are NOT gated:
// watching other machines is the whole point of a capture-less node.
// Audio is gated separately (`audio-io`, included in `host`): it's the one
// capture plane iOS can genuinely run — cpal speaks CoreAudio there — so
// the phone builds it real while the rest stay stubs.
/// AMD AMF encode — the Radeon twin of `nvenc`, in progress (loader +
/// availability probe today; component vtables next). Runtime-loaded from
