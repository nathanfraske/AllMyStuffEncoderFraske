//! Device ownership — the persisted answer to "whose machine is this?"
//!
//! AllMyStuff's rule (the one the user asked for): you can't *flat-out take
//! ownership* of a device on the mesh. A claim only takes if the device is
//! in **claim mode** — started with `ALLMYSTUFF_CLAIMABLE=1`, or with its
//! owner having toggled "allow adoption" in its own UI. Otherwise the device
//! defines its own owner (whatever it has recorded, or nobody), and a peer
//! can look but not grab.
//!
//! Two pieces of state, treated differently on purpose:
//!
//!  * **owner** — *persisted* next to the mesh identity under `~/.myownmesh`
//!    (`MYOWNMESH_HOME`-overridable), so a device remembers who owns it
//!    across restarts exactly like the mesh remembers its keys.
//!  * **claim mode** — *not* persisted. It's a transient "I'm offering this
//!    device right now" state, re-asserted each start by the
//!    `ALLMYSTUFF_CLAIMABLE` flag, so a box never sits silently adoptable
//!    across reboots after you toggled it on once.
