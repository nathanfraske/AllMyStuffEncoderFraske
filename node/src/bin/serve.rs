//! `allmystuff-serve` — run this machine as a mesh node with **no GUI**.
//!
//! This is the headless half of AllMyStuff. The desktop app's Tauri backend
//! and this binary link the very same engine ([`allmystuff_node`]); the only
//! difference is what's wired to [`UiSink`] — the app feeds events to its
//! Svelte front-end, and here they just go to the log, because there's no
//! front-end to feed. Everything a peer can do *to* this machine still works:
//! a console connecting to watch its screen (**monitor out**), a fleet member
//! opening a terminal, a room asking for its camera or system audio.
//!
//! It is also self-contained as a unit: AllMyStuff is a client of a
//! `myownmesh serve` daemon, so this binary **spawns and supervises that
//! daemon itself** (reusing the same logic the GUI uses). One process brings
//! up both — which is what lets a single `allmystuff service` install run the
//! whole node on a headless box. Users normally reach it as `allmystuff
//! serve`, which execs this binary.
//!
//! ```text
//! allmystuff serve                       # run this machine on the mesh, headless
//! ALLMYSTUFF_CLAIMABLE=1 allmystuff serve # …and let one of your machines adopt it
//! ALLMYSTUFF_LOG=debug allmystuff serve   # …with verbose logs
//! allmystuff serve --log debug            # …same, as a flag
//! ```
//!
//! **Windows service mode.** `allmystuff service install` registers this binary
//! with the Service Control Manager as `<exe> --service`. That flag flips it
//! into [`winsvc`] mode: it answers the SCM's control protocol (a plain console
//! binary would be killed for not doing so) and logs to a file (no console to
//! print to). systemd and launchd need no such mode — they run the binary as
//! an ordinary foreground process and signal it with SIGTERM.
//!
//! **Unattended self-update.** Headless and as a service the node is meant to
//! be "always on, always current": its background updater doesn't just stage a
//! release for the next launch (a service box might not restart for months) —
//! it applies the update and relaunches onto it, on all three OSes. See
//! [`allmystuff_updater::tick_forever_unattended`].
