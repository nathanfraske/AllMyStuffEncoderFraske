# AllMyStuff GUI

Tauri 2 + Svelte 5. The friendly graph that scans your machine and wires
your stuff together. On desktop it is a **client** of the per-machine node
(`allmystuff-serve`) over its control socket — it never runs the engine
itself. The one exception is the phone, where no separate process is
allowed: `mobile/` embeds the same engine in-process (see
[docs/MOBILE.md](../docs/MOBILE.md)).

                              #   workspace. Embeds the myownmesh daemon + the
                              #   capture-less node engine IN-PROCESS and answers
                              #   the same command surface (docs/MOBILE.md)
```

The mesh node itself — the control-socket transport, the daemon spawner, and
every media plane — lives in the **`allmystuff-node`** crate (`../node`),
which `allmystuff serve` runs headless. Both shells are webview wiring on
top of the same engine: the desktop reaches it over a socket, the phone
links it.

## Develop

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm check        # svelte-check (types)
pnpm build        # vite production build (no webview needed)
pnpm tauri dev    # full desktop app — needs the Linux webview deps + a daemon
```

The front-end is the part that builds anywhere. The Tauri backend links the
system webview, so building the desktop app on Linux needs `libgtk-3-dev` and
`libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`; macOS and Windows use their built-in webviews. The
mobile shell's builds are documented in [docs/MOBILE.md](../docs/MOBILE.md).

## Web mode vs desktop vs mobile

`tauri.ts` detects whether a Tauri backend is present. With one, `scan_self`
replaces the demo "this device" with a real scan and the mesh commands light
up. Without one (a plain `pnpm dev` in a browser, or this repo's CI build),
the demo graph stands in so the whole experience — clicking nodes, drawing
connections, the share sheet, rooms — works offline.

Mobile is a *runtime posture* of the same bundle, not a fork: `isMobile()`
keeps every surface in-app (desktop pops consoles/terminals/files/rooms out
into OS windows), the touch modules take over the pointer work, and
`html.is-mobile` + media queries compact the chrome. Desktop-only affordances
(the updater tab, the Always-On service, network export's save dialog) hide
themselves on the phone.

## Backend events

The backend pumps the engine's event stream out as `allmystuff://…` Tauri
events (and `cec://…` for CEC Support) and tracks connection state under
`allmystuff://subscription` (query `mesh_subscription_state` after
registering the listener to avoid the fire-and-forget race — the MyOwnMesh
GUI pattern). On desktop that pump crosses the node socket; on mobile the
engine's `UiSink` emits straight onto the webview bus. Same events, same
names, either way.
